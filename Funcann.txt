Module1: functional annotation -> open in window
		a. clustering -> At 0.5 cutoff 1024 genes =>  622 DAVID ids => 78 clusters ordered by Enirchment score (Gene-Enrichment: A set of user's input genes is highly associated with certain terms, which is statistically measured by Fisher Exact in DAVID system.	
); 2D view; 
		b. chart: No clustering (Mainly for processes/pathways instead of individual functions)
		c. table: All genes participating in different functional terms.

Module2: Function classisification (Max 3000 genes).
